# FP growth
C implementation of FP growth tree and mining frequent itemsets.


### Note
Please execute the following command to run the code:
```
gcc fpTree_final.c  -lm
./a.out
```
### General Instructions
1. Let the data file be in the same folder as that of the code file.
2. Attached files output_0.02.txt and output_0.05.txt contain the outputs of the code for the minimum support of 0.02 and 0.05 respectively.
(Since the output is so long to be fit on hte terminal screen, we chose this way of showing the output)
3. Report.pdf is the report of the submission.
4. The code currently takes in the sample.csv file as input and the corresponding output is shown in the screenshots SAMPLE_OUT_1.png and SAMPLE_OUT_2.png.
5. To use the actual dataset and run the code, ctrl+h > replace sample with groceries_subset; the minimum support count can be changed at line no: 11.
6. Feel free to refer to "Report.pdf" in this repo for further details.
